   Context: ASSIGNMENT_1.PUBLIC
   Goal:
     If launching a new YouTube channel tomorrow, which category
     (excluding 'Music' and 'Entertainment') should we choose for JP
     to appear in top trends? Will this work in every country?
     Also: measure "improbability" = strong in JP but weak elsewhere.
